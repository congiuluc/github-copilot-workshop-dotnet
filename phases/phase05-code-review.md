## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Setup Code for Review üîß

**Prepare code with intentional issues for Copilot to review:**

1. **Create a problematic service class:**
   - Right-click the `Services` folder in VS Code Explorer
   - Select "New File"
   - Name it `ProblematicTaskService.cs`

2. **Add code with various issues for review:**
   ```csharp
   using TaskManagement.API.Models;
   using TaskManagement.API.Data;
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
   
   namespace TaskManagement.API.Services;
   
   public class ProblematicTaskService
   {
       private ApplicationDbContext context;
       
       public ProblematicTaskService(ApplicationDbContext ctx)
       {
           context = ctx; // Should use readonly field
       }
       
       // Security issue: No input validation
       public TaskItem GetTaskById(int id)
       {
           return context.Tasks.Find(id); // Potential null return
       }
       
       // Performance issue: N+1 problem
       public List<TaskItem> GetAllTasksWithUsers()
       {
           var tasks = context.Tasks.ToList();
           foreach (var task in tasks)
           {
               task.User = context.Users.Find(task.UserId); // N+1 query
           }
           return tasks;
       }
       
       // Error handling issue: No exception management
       public void UpdateTask(TaskItem task)
       {
           context.Tasks.Update(task);
           context.SaveChanges(); // Can throw exceptions
       }
       
       // Memory leak: No disposal
       public void ProcessLargeBatch()
       {
           var largeDataSet = context.Tasks.ToList(); // Loads everything
           // Process data without disposing properly
       }
       
       // Security vulnerability: SQL injection potential
       public List<TaskItem> SearchTasks(string searchTerm)
       {
           var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Tasks WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
           return context.Tasks.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify the code compiles:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet build .\src\TaskManagement.API\
   ```

---

### Step 2: Review Code with VS Code üîç

**Use GitHub Copilot to review your code in VS Code:**

1. **Review a selection of code:**
   - Select the entire `GetTaskById` method in VS Code
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Search for and select **"GitHub Copilot: Review and Comment"**
   - Wait for Copilot to analyze the selected code

2. **Review all uncommitted changes:**
   - Open the Source Control view (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
   - Click the **Copilot Code Review** button (sparkle icon) next to "CHANGES"
   - Wait for Copilot to review your uncommitted changes
   - Review the comments that appear inline in your files

3. **Examine the feedback:**
   - Check the **Problems** tab for Copilot's comments
   - Review inline comments in your code files
   - Note the specific issues Copilot identifies

**Expected Issues Copilot Should Identify:**
- Potential null reference in `GetTaskById`
- N+1 query problem in `GetAllTasksWithUsers`
- Missing error handling in `UpdateTask`
- SQL injection vulnerability in `SearchTasks`
- Performance issues with loading large datasets

---

### Step 3: Apply Suggested Changes üõ†Ô∏è

**Work with Copilot's suggestions:**

1. **Review Copilot's feedback:**
   - Read through each comment carefully
   - Look for suggested code changes
   - Understand the reasoning behind each suggestion

2. **Apply suggestions with one click:**
   - For suggestions with code changes, click **"Apply and Go To Next"**
   - For suggestions you don't want to apply, click **"Discard and Go to Next"**
   - Navigate through all suggestions systematically

3. **Verify applied changes:**
   - Review the changes Copilot made to your code
   - Ensure the fixes align with your requirements
   - Test that the code still compiles correctly

**Example of Expected Improved Code:**
```csharp
// Copilot should suggest improvements like:
public async Task<TaskItem?> GetTaskByIdAsync(int id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (id <= 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("ID must be greater than zero", nameof(id));
    
    return await _context.Tasks.FindAsync(id, cancellationToken);
}

public async Task<List<TaskItem>> GetAllTasksWithUsersAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    return await _context.Tasks
        .Include(t => t.User)
        .ToListAsync(cancellationToken);
}
```

   ```powershell
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with problematic code"
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for improvements:**
   ```powershell
   git checkout -b feature/code-improvements
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add problematic code for review demonstration"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub and create PR:**
   ```powershell
   # Push to your GitHub repository
   git push origin feature/code-improvements
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request on GitHub:**
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.com
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Add title: "Code improvements and security fixes"
