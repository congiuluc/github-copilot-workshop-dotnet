   ```
   I'm building a Task Management API in .NET 8. I need to create a TaskController with full CRUD operations for TaskItem entities. 

   The controller should:
   - Follow REST API conventions
   - Include proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 400, 500)
   - Have comprehensive input validation
   - Include error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Use dependency injection for the service layer
   - Include OpenAPI/Swagger documentation attributes
   - Support filtering and pagination for GET operations

   Can you help me design the controller structure and explain the best practices?
   ```

   - Type this follow-up prompt:
   ```
   What specific attributes should I use for OpenAPI documentation? And what's the best way to handle validation errors in the controller?
   ```
### Step 3: Create the Service Layer Interface üõ†Ô∏è

**Design the service layer using Chat guidance:**

1. **Ask Chat to design the service interface:**
   - In Copilot Chat, type this exact prompt:
   ```
   Before creating the controller, I need a service layer. Can you create a TaskService interface and implementation that:

   Interface requirements:
   - Uses async methods for all CRUD operations
   - Methods: GetAllAsync, GetByIdAsync, CreateAsync, UpdateAsync, DeleteAsync
   - Includes proper return types (Task<List<TaskItem>>, Task<TaskItem?>, etc.)
   - Has filtering and pagination support
   - Follows dependency injection patterns

   Implementation requirements:
   - Uses the ApplicationDbContext from Phase 1
   - Includes comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Has proper logging with ILogger
   - Follows async/await best practices
   - Uses Entity Framework Core effectively

   Show me both the interface and implementation with complete code.
   ```
   - Press `Enter` and wait for response

2. **Review the suggested interface:**
   - ‚úÖ Check that all CRUD methods are included
   - ‚úÖ Verify async/await patterns are used
   - ‚úÖ Look for proper return types

3. **Create the Service folder and interface:**
   - Right-click project root ‚Üí "New Folder" ‚Üí Name it `Services`
   - Right-click `Services` folder ‚Üí "New File" ‚Üí Name it `ITaskService.cs`
   - Copy the interface code from Chat response and paste it into the file

### Step 4: Implement the Service Class üìù

**Get Chat's help to create the implementation:**

1. **Ask Chat for the complete implementation:**
   - In Copilot Chat, type:
   ```
   Now create the TaskService implementation class. I need:

   Class structure:
   - Implements ITaskService interface
   - Constructor with ApplicationDbContext and ILogger<TaskService> dependencies
   - All interface methods implemented with full business logic

   Implementation details:
   - Use Entity Framework Core for database operations
   - Include comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Add logging for all operations (start, success, error)
   - Use async/await properly with ConfigureAwait(false)
   - Handle not found scenarios gracefully
   - Include input validation where appropriate

   Show me the complete TaskService class with all methods implemented.
   ```

2. **Create the implementation file:**
   - Right-click `Services` folder ‚Üí "New File" ‚Üí Name it `TaskService.cs`
   - Copy the implementation code from Chat response

3. **Ask for specific method improvements:**
   - If any method seems incomplete, ask Chat:
   ```
   Can you improve the GetAllAsync method to include filtering by status and priority, plus pagination support?
   ```

4. **Register services in Program.cs:**
   - Ask Chat: 
   ```
   How do I register the TaskService in Program.cs for dependency injection? Show me the exact code to add.
   ```
   - Add the suggested registration code to your `Program.cs`

### Step 5: Create the Controller with Chat Guidance üéÆ

**Use Chat to build the complete controller:**

1. **Request the full controller implementation:**
   - In Copilot Chat, type this comprehensive prompt:
   ```
   Now create the TaskController class. Requirements:

   Controller structure:
   - [ApiController] and [Route("api/[controller]")] attributes
   - Constructor with ITaskService and ILogger<TaskController> dependencies
   - All REST endpoints: GET, GET by ID, POST, PUT, DELETE

   Endpoint specifications:
   - GET /api/tasks - GetAllTasks (with optional filtering)
   - GET /api/tasks/{id} - GetTask by ID
   - POST /api/tasks - CreateTask
   - PUT /api/tasks/{id} - UpdateTask  
   - DELETE /api/tasks/{id} - DeleteTask

   Each endpoint needs:
   - Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 400, 500)
   - OpenAPI/Swagger attributes with descriptions
   - Input validation with ModelState.IsValid
   - Error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Appropriate return types (ActionResult<T>)

   Show me the complete controller with all endpoints implemented.
   ```

2. **Create the controller file:**
   - Right-click project root ‚Üí "New Folder" ‚Üí Name it `Controllers` (if not exists)
   - Right-click `Controllers` folder ‚Üí "New File" ‚Üí Name it `TaskController.cs`
   - Copy the complete controller code from Chat response

3. **Verify controller endpoints:**
   - Ask Chat to review:
   ```
   Can you review this TaskController and suggest any improvements for error handling or HTTP status codes?
   ```

### Step 6: Get Code Review from Chat üîç

**Use Chat as your code reviewer:**

1. **Request a comprehensive code review:**
   - Select all the code in your `TaskController.cs` file
   - In Copilot Chat, type:
   ```
   Please review this TaskController code for:
   - Best practices adherence
   - Error handling completeness  
   - HTTP status code appropriateness
   - Security considerations
   - Performance optimizations
   - Missing functionality

   Suggest specific improvements with code examples.
   ```

2. **Ask about specific concerns:**
   - Type follow-up questions:
   ```
   Should I add authorization attributes to these endpoints? And how can I improve the error responses to be more informative?
   ```

3. **Request validation improvements:**
   - Ask Chat:
   ```
   How can I add custom validation attributes to the TaskItem model to ensure data quality? Show me examples.
   ```

### Step 7: Test and Validate with Chat Support üß™

**Get testing guidance from Chat:**

1. **Ask for testing strategy:**

   - ‚úÖ Test GET operations
   - ‚úÖ Test POST operation with sample data
   - ‚úÖ Verify responses and status codes

### Step 8: Advanced Chat Techniques üöÄ

**Learn advanced Chat features:**

1. **Context-aware conversations:**
   - Select a specific method in your code
   - In Chat, type:
   ```
   @workspace How can I improve this selected method's performance?
   ```

2. **Multi-file analysis:**
   - Type in Chat:
   ```
   @workspace Analyze the relationship between my TaskService and TaskController. Are there any architectural improvements I should make?
   ```

3. **Documentation generation:**
   - Ask Chat:
   ```
   Generate comprehensive XML documentation comments for all public methods in my TaskController. Include parameter descriptions and return value explanations.
   ```

/// <summary>
/// Interface for task management operations
/// </summary>
public interface ITaskService
{
    Task<IEnumerable<TaskItem>> GetAllAsync();
    Task<TaskItem?> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<TaskItem> CreateAsync(TaskItem taskItem);
    Task<TaskItem?> UpdateAsync(int id, TaskItem taskItem);
    Task<bool> DeleteAsync(int id);
    Task<bool> ExistsAsync(int id);
}
```

2. **Ask Chat for the implementation:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 3:
Now create the TaskService implementation. Make sure to:
- Inject TaskDbContext
- Use async/await properly
- Handle entity not found scenarios
- Include proper logging
- Validate input parameters
```

3. **Create the implementation** in `Services/TaskService.cs` based on Chat's response:

### Step 4: Advanced Chat - Error Handling Strategy üö®

**Ask for advanced guidance:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 4:
I want to implement a robust error handling strategy for my API. Can you:
1. Suggest custom exception classes for different scenarios
2. Show me how to implement a global exception handler
3. Provide examples of how to use these in the service layer
4. Include appropriate HTTP status codes for each exception type

Focus on TaskNotFoundException, ValidationException, and DatabaseException scenarios.
```

1. **Create the exception classes** in `Exceptions/` folder based on Chat's suggestions

2. **Follow Chat's guidance** to implement global exception handling

### Step 5: Interactive Controller Design üéÆ

**Design the controller through conversation:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 5:
Now let's create the TaskController. I want it to:
- Use the ITaskService through DI
- Have these endpoints:
  * GET /api/tasks (get all tasks with optional filtering)
  * GET /api/tasks/{id} (get specific task)
  * POST /api/tasks (create new task)
  * PUT /api/tasks/{id} (update existing task)
  * DELETE /api/tasks/{id} (delete task)
- Include proper validation attributes
- Return appropriate status codes
- Include XML documentation for Swagger
- Handle the custom exceptions we created

Show me the complete controller with all endpoints.
```

1. **Create the controller** in `Controllers/TaskController.cs`

2. **Follow the implementation** provided by Chat

### Step 6: Validation and DTOs üìã

**Ask Chat about DTOs:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 6:
I think we should use DTOs instead of exposing domain models directly. Can you:
1. Create CreateTaskDto and UpdateTaskDto classes
2. Show me how to map between DTOs and domain models
3. Add validation attributes to the DTOs
4. Update the controller to use these DTOs
5. Suggest a mapping strategy (manual mapping or AutoMapper)

Keep it simple but production-ready.
```

**Follow Chat's suggestions** to implement DTOs and mapping.

### Step 7: Advanced Questioning Techniques üß†

**Practice different types of Chat interactions:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 7:
Explain this code:
[Paste the OnModelCreating method from TaskDbContext]

Why did you suggest this specific configuration? What are the alternatives?
```

```
üéØ PROMPT 8:
What are the pros and cons of using:
1. Repository pattern vs Direct DbContext injection
2. Async/await vs synchronous methods
3. Custom exceptions vs built-in exceptions

In the context of a .NET Web API?
```

```
üéØ PROMPT 9:
Review my TaskController and suggest 3 improvements for:
- Performance
- Security
- Maintainability

Provide specific code examples for each suggestion.
```

### Step 8: Chat-Driven Testing Strategy üß™

**Plan testing with Chat:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 10:
I want to add comprehensive testing to my Task API. Can you create:
1. Unit tests for TaskService using a mock DbContext
2. Integration tests for TaskController
3. A test data builder pattern for TaskItem
4. Setup instructions for the test project

Use xUnit, Moq, and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.
```

### Step 9: Register Services and Complete Setup üîß

**Ask Chat for final configuration:**

```
üéØ PROMPT 11:
Help me complete the dependency injection setup in Program.cs. I need to register:
- TaskService
- Exception handling middleware
- Any other services we created

Also, what additional middleware should I consider for a production API?
```

**Update `Program.cs`** based on Chat's recommendations:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using TaskManagementAPI.Data;
using TaskManagementAPI.Services;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

// Configure Entity Framework
builder.Services.AddDbContext<TaskDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

// Register application services
builder.Services.AddScoped<ITaskService, TaskService>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```
